After the initial deal, the player
seats are shown as follows:

#1 --
ö2 Q5
#3=--

The "ö" shows the seated human.
The "Q5" are the human's cards.
The "--" are the opponents' cards.
The "=" is the dealer's card deck.

Below the seats, the amount of
money in the pot and the human's
stake are shown:

 Pot: $3
 ö $99

The following symbols are used
to display the betting action:

 #  Means the player Checked
 +n Means the player Bet or Raised $n
 =n Means the player Called $n
 x  Means the player Folded

 ±  Means the player Drew a card
 -  Means the player Held both cards

For example, reading top to bottom,
left to right:

#1 -- # +1± # =3
ö2 Q2 +2=1- +3
#3=   =2=1± x

 #1 Checked, #2 Bet $2, #3 Called.
 #1 Raised $1, #2 and #3 called.
 #1 Drew a card, #2 Held, #3 Drew.
 #1 Checked, #2 Bet $3, #3 Folded.
 #1 Called.

Finally, there is the Showdown,
which uses three new symbols:

 $n Means the player won $n
 !  Means the player had High hand
 ¡ Means the player had Low hand

#1¡54 # +1± # =3 $4
ö2 Q2! +2=1- +3 $5
#3=   =2=1± x

 #1 had Low hand, winning $4.
 #2 had High hand, winning $5.
    (Odd chip goes to the High hand.)
