Hurricane is two-card draw poker,
deuces wild, played as high/low;
aces, deuces play both high and low.
</p>
<p>
No straights, no flushes are used;
only pairs and high-card hands occur.
</p>
<p>
Checking is allowed;
the maximum bet or raise is $3.
1 bet and 2 raises are allowed
per betting round.
</p>
<p>
After dealing two cards to each
player, the player to the dealer's
left starts the first betting round.
This is the "leading edge" of
the storm.
</p>
<p>
After the first round of betting,
players may optionally discard a card
and draw a replacement.
This is the "eye of the storm".
</p>
<p>
The player to the dealer's left
then starts the final betting round.
This is the "trailing edge" of
the storm.
</p>
<p>
After the final round of betting,
there is a showdown among the
survivors, and damage is assessed!
</p>
<p>
The High hand and the Low hand
split the pot.
(Odd chip goes to the High hand.)
If hands are tied, those players
divide that half of the pot evenly.
</p>
<p>
Remember that 2's are wild,
and can be used as different cards
in the High and the Low hands.
However, two 2's are always a pair.
</p>
<p>
An Ace is the top card in High hands,
and the low card in Low hands.
An "Acey-Deucy" (A2) always wins
both High hand (as a pair of Aces)
and Low hand (as an Ace and a Deuce).
</p>
<p>
For the high hand A2 ties with 22
as a pair of Aces; for the low hand
A2 beats 22 since 22 is still a low pair,
and A2 chooses a natural 2 for the wild value.
</p>
<p>
For the low hand 23 ties with A3 since 
23 chooses Ace for the wild value.
</p>
<p>
Eight players sit at the octagonal
poker table.  The house randomly
assigns you a seat (marked with ö)
and picks the first dealer
(marked with a card deck: =).
</p>
<p>
To start a hand, select "Deal" from
the main menu.
</p>
<p>
Select "New Deck" from the main menu
to open and shuffle a new deck
of cards.
</p>
<p>
A player may go into debt to finish
a hand.
When any player has no money for the
ante, the game is over.
The remaining stakes of all players
are then shown.
</p>
<p>
Shorthand symbols are used to show
the betting action.
</p>
<code>
After the initial deal, the player
seats are shown as follows:

#1 --
ö2 Q5
#3=--

The "ö" shows the seated human.
The "Q5" are the human's cards.
The "--" are the opponents' cards.
The "=" is the dealer's card deck.

Below the seats, the amount of
money in the pot and the human's
stake are shown:

 Pot: $3
 ö $99

The following symbols are used
to display the betting action:

 #  Means the player Checked
 +n Means the player Bet or Raised $n
 =n Means the player Called $n
 x  Means the player Folded

 ±  Means the player Drew a card
 -  Means the player Held both cards

For example, reading top to bottom,
left to right:

#1 -- # +1± # =3
ö2 Q2 +2=1- +3
#3=   =2=1± x

 #1 Checked, #2 Bet $2, #3 Called.
 #1 Raised $1, #2 and #3 called.
 #1 Drew a card, #2 Held, #3 Drew.
 #1 Checked, #2 Bet $3, #3 Folded.
 #1 Called.

Finally, there is the Showdown,
which uses three new symbols:

 $n Means the player won $n
 ▲  Means the player had High hand
 ▼ Means the player had Low hand

#1▼54 # +1± # =3 $4
ö2 Q2▲ +2=1- +3 $5
#3=   =2=1± x

 #1 had Low hand, winning $4.
 #2 had High hand, winning $5.
    (Odd chip goes to the High hand.)

            typically discarding
            the highest card

            Low hand, typically
            discarding "middle" cards
